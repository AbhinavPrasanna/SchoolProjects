This goal of this assignment to perform a depth first search using a graph data structure, stack data structure, and path data structure. The path data structure uses accessor functions to determine if the path is within the bounds of the graph and if it is a correct path. The stack data structure pushes every individual position for the graph in the path and analyzes which path is the most efficient. The graph data structure creates a 2D matrix of the full graph for the location and determine what is in bounds. The program is built using make all to build the function and doing ./tsp to run the function. There is -u flag for undirected graphs, -v flag for verbose printing, -i infile for input containing graph, and -o file for output of the computed file.
