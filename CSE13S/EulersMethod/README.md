For this graph of BBP.c, we can see that the graph statrs from 3.133 and approaches pi at term 3 and keeps approaching 
pretty fast till 11. This shows that BBP is a very accurate formula.
https://git.ucsc.edu/cse13s/fall2021/aprasann/-/blob/master/asgn2/e.pdf
For this graph of our e formula, we approach the value of e near term 4 and keep approaching till the last term. As 
specified in the design document, we stop our e function as we approach epsilon in our last term.
https://git.ucsc.edu/cse13s/fall2021/aprasann/-/blob/master/asgn2/euler.pdf
For this graph for our euler formula, we approach the value of pi near term 4 and keep approaching till the last term. 
As specified in the design document, we stop our euler function till we approach epsilon in our last term.
https://git.ucsc.edu/cse13s/fall2021/aprasann/-/blob/master/asgn2/madhava.pdf
For this graph of madhava formula, we approach the value of pi when we reach near term 5 and steadily approach PI.
As specified in the design document, we stop our madhava function till we approach epsilon in our last term.
https://git.ucsc.edu/cse13s/fall2021/aprasann/-/blob/master/asgn2/newton.pdf
Our newton formula is the most accurate as we keep up with the square root function shown in the graph. Newton is the
most accurate function of all the formulas.
https://git.ucsc.edu/cse13s/fall2021/aprasann/-/blob/master/asgn2/viete.pdf
Our viete formula approaches pi at term 20 and 45 as 1-our current term approaches epsilon.
