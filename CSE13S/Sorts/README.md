This readme describes how the functionality works. Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.Shellsort, also known as Shell sort or Shell's method, is an in-place comparison sort. It can be seen as either a generalization of sorting by exchange or sorting by insertion. Quicksort is an in-place sorting algorithm. Developed by British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959 and published in 1961, it is still a commonly used algorithm for sorting.In computer science, heapsort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. Heapsort can be thought of as an improved selection sort: like selection sort, heapsort divides its input into a sorted. We can just take the pesudocode for the sorting algorithms from python and convert them using C. We use the helper functions in stats.c to keep track of the moves, swaps, and comparisons for each temp variable and array element. We use set.h for keep track of the flags and a test harness with the specified flags for the individual sorting algorithms.
