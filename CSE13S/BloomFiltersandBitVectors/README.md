This assignment is about teaching students how to create a word filter for filtering out certain bad words. In this assignment we were tasked with creating Bloom Filters, Bit Vector,Hash Tables, Binary Search Tree, Node, and a Ban Hammer. We use the bloom filter to store different bit vectors representing true and false values and using bitwise operators to find these values. We use the hashtable to store binary search trees consisting of Nodes which will store the oldspeak and newspeak values. BSTs will use recursion for finding, inserting, deleting, and printing. The hashtable will use the hash function to find the index using the Salt.h header. Banhammer uses all of these files to read a badspeak or newspeak file and store them in our Hashtable and Bloom Filters. We will then probe our bloom filter and sort the values according to which Binary Search Tree they should be in. Finally, we willprint out our goodspeak, mixspeak, and badspeak values. We will also create flags to set custom sizes and to print out statistics. Statistics is used to print out the ht size and height, average traversals, hash table load, and bloom filter load.
