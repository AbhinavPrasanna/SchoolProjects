The List ADT contains the accessor functions for the different elements, the length, and position of the cursor. The List has getter and setter functions along with linear search algorithms to help for our shuffle.c function. Shuffle.c calculates the total amount of shuffles till the given list. The List ADT changes from .C files since we now have a cursor in the middle of two elements beforeCursor and afterCursor along with a frontDummy which is bookmark for the front end of the list and backDummy bookmarking the back end of the list. This changes our accessor, getter, and setter functions.
