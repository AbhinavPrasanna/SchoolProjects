This program computes several matrix mathematical operations, consisting of adding, subtracting, multiplying. Given any 2 matrices, the program will then compute the addition, subtractions, and scalar multplication of the given matrices, while also being able to output the tranpose.

The files that are part of this program are the following:

List.h - This file contains the list of functions that are needed to be implemented for the file List.c
List.c - This file provides the full and cohesive implmentation of the functions and methods that are listed in List.h
Matrix.h - This file contains the list of method and functions that are needed to be implemented for the file Matrix.c
Matrix.c - This is the file that contains the full implementation of the all of the functions listed in Matrix.h
MatrixTest.c - This is a sample testing harness to test out the full functionality of Matrix ADT
ListTest.c - This is a testing harness to test out the full functionality of the List ADT
Sparse.c - This is the main program that utilizes all of the matrix functions that's created in Matrix.c
Makefile - This file performs the compilation of this program
